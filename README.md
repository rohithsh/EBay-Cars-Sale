# EBay-Cars-Sale
Performing EDA on the  "Cars on Sale" data set from EBay Germany.

I have used numpy and pandas libraries to perform EDA and basic data cleaning on the **"autos.csv"** dataset.

This project is part of the 3rd Chapter in the **Data Analyst in Python** course track on Dataquest.
This chapter introduced me to the numpy and pandas libraries, boolean indexing and EDA.
